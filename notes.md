### What is Kafka?
Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system.Data is written to Kafka topics by producers and consumed from those topics by consumers.
### Why do we need Kafka ?

Suppose we have these applications which need to communicate with each other. One bottlneck is maintaining multiple connections at all times. If 1 of the application goes down, all data coming to that application will be lost. Here Kafka comes into picture

All the publishing applications will publish data and receiving applications will consume the data whenever they are avaialable, this way we maintain relatively lesser number of connections between applications

### Important members of kafka

#### Broker : 
A Kafka broker is a single Kafka server. Its job is to:
- Receive messages from producers.
- Store them on disk (in partitions).
- Serve consumers who want to read the messages.
Each broker can handle hundreds or thousands of topics and millions of messages per second, depending on hardware and configuration.

Example:
If you have a Kafka system with 3 servers running, each running Kafka, then you have 3 brokers.

#### Cluster : 
- A Kafka cluster is a group of one or more Kafka brokers that work together.
- Brokers in a cluster share data and workload.
- Topics and their partitions are distributed across brokers.
- One broker acts as the MASTER, managing partition leadership and cluster metadata.
- Kafka uses ZooKeeper (or KRaft in newer versions) to manage broker coordination.
- The cluster ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

Suppose producer is producing huge volume of data, then a single kafka broker may not be able to handle the load. In that case               we need to add multiple brokers who can consume requests parallely to levarage scalability.

#### Producer : 
A Kafka producer is a client that sends (publishes) data to Kafka topics.
Producers are responsible for:
- Choosing the topic to send the message to.
- Optionally choosing the partition (or Kafka decides automatically).
- Serializing the message.
- Sending the message over the network to a Kafka broker.

```
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(<topic-name>, <partition-key>, <message>));
```
- If the partition-key is provided, Kafka will hash the key and map it to a partition. If no partition-key is provided, Kafka does a round-robin distribution across partitions.
- A topic can have multiple partitions, and each partition is hosted on a different broker. So messages published to a topic might go to different brokers.
- Before writing data to a topic, producer requests metadata about the cluster from a broker. The metadata tells on which broker is the partition leader residing and the producer always writes on the leader


üß† Summary
- What is a producer?	A client that sends messages to Kafka topics
- Where does it publish?	To a topic, then routed to a partition on a broker
- Always to same broker?	‚ùå No ‚Äî it depends on the partition's location
- Always to same topic?	‚ùå No ‚Äî the producer can choose different topics
- Always to same partition?	‚úÖ If the key is fixed
                            ‚ùå If no key is used

#### Consumer : 
- A Kafka consumer is a client that reads messages from one or more Kafka topics.
- Every message in a Kafka partition has a unique offset (like a position/index). The consumer keeps track of which offset it has read so it can resume where it left off.
- Kafka ensures each partition is only read by one consumer in the group.
- If we have 3 partitions and 2 consumers, 1 will sit idle until 1 more partition is added.
- Consumers can subscribe to multiple topics at a time.

```
consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("user-events"));
```

#### Topic : 
Kafka topics are the categories used to organize messages. 

```
NOTE : If the broker's setting for 'auto.create.topics.enable' is 'true' (default) then a new topic will be created whenever a consumer or a producer tries to read or write a topic that is not present on the cluster. Same type of messages are pushed to 1 topic e.g. paymentinfo, orderData etc.
```
#### Partition : 
A partition is a physical subdivision of a topic. Every topic is split into one or more partitions. Why is a topic divided?
Each partition:

- Is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.
- Stores data sequentially.
- Is assigned to a broker (Kafka server) for load balancing.
- Has its own offsets (a unique ID for each record within that partition).
- They follow LIFO rule while processing the messages.
- Replication is done at the partition level (each partition has replicas).
- Each partition has 1 consumer out of a consumer group. Suppose there are n partitions of a topic. Each partition contain data of same category. So there will be 1 consumer group consisting of n consumers each reading from a different partition to enable parallel processing.
- One consumer in the group can consume more than one partition
- Each partition has replicas on multiple brokers. So even if a broker fails, another broker with a replica can take over.
- Replicas of a partition follow master slave architecture.n When producer writes message to a partition, the message is written to the replica leader and it's offset is increased. Leader handles all read and write to a topic and followers replicate the leader. 

#### Offset : 
- An offset is a unique identifier for each message within a partition. It acts like a pointer or index, helping Kafka keep track of the position of messages.
- It is needed to maintain an index to check what all data has been read by the consumer. Suppose, consumer reads till offset 3 and goes down for some time, after it again becomes active we will have a record of what data has been consumed and what is left.
  
```
NOTE : Unlike rabbitMQ, messages once read from a partition are not deleted because multiple consumers are allowed to read from a parition.
Instead of deletion, offsets increase per consumer so that next time they do not read the same message.
```


#### Consumer Group : 
- A group of consumers working together to read from same topic in parallel.
- Kafka ensures each partition is only read by one consumer in the group.
- This allows horizontal scaling of processing.
- Just like 1 consumer is associated with 1 partition, 1 consumer group is associated with 1 topic.
- Consumer group is needed to implement parallel processing. Suppose a topic receives 1000 delivery updates per minute for orders and it has only 1 partition. It will be consumed by a single consumer who processes 1 message at a time. This will lead to delay in message processing for older orders. If same task is being done by n consumers, n messages will be processed at the same time.

#### Zookeeper
- Kafka is a distributed system with multiple brokers. It needs:
- A central place to store metadata, like:
- What topics exist.
- Where partitions are located.
- Which broker is the leader for each partition.
- Coordination between brokers, like:
- Electing a controller broker.
- Handling broker failures.
